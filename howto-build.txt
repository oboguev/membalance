                            Building membalance
                            *******************

PREREQUISITES:
==============

Development/build system requires the following packages to be installed:

    libxen-dev
    uuid-dev
    
For example, on Ubuntu execute:

    sudo apt-get install libxen-dev uuid-dev
    
Also required is Xen header file "libxlutil.h" which currently is not included
with libxen-dev. To obtain this file (if missing under /usr/include), download
Xen source tree and point it by environment variable XEN, for example:

    mkdir ~/gits/xen
    cd ~/gits/xen
    git clone git://xenbits.xen.org/xen.git
    [optionally:]  git checkout stable-4.4  [or stable-4.5 etc.]
    export XEN=~/gits/xen
    
If environment varaible XEN is left unspecified, makefile defaults its value
to ~/gits/xen.


BUILD:
======

From membalance root directory, execute:

    ( cd src/membalance; make rebuild )
    ( cd src/memprobe; make rebuild )

The following options can be added to the make command:

    DEBUG=1  Enables debug build
    
    DEVEL=1  Enables development-time code 
    
It might be possible for a build to fail with error message
    
    /usr/include/xenctrl.h: error: use of enum "xc_error_code" without previous declaration
    
This indicates an outdated file "xenctrl.h". If you see this error, try to
update package libxen-dev. If you already have installed the latest version of
the package available for your Linux distro installed and the fix to
"xenctrl.h" still did not make into it, edit "/usr/include/xenctrl.h" manually.
Move line

    typedef enum xc_error_code xc_error_code;

past 

    enum xc_error_code {
    ...
    };

Then re-run make.
