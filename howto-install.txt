                            Installing membalance
                            *********************

Membalance is composed of two parts: "membalance" daemon that should be
installed and run in Dom0, and "memprobe" daemon that should be installed
and run in every managed DomU.

There is currently no distro-specific membalance packages available to be
installed with utilities like apt or yum. Instead, membalance/memprobe have
to be installed by manually executing "make install" from build directory.

Furthermore, daemon scripts are available and have been tested only for
Ubuntu.

Daemon scripts for OpenSUSE are included with the source, but currently have
not been tested yet.


PREREQUISITES for Dom0
======================

There are no prerequisites for Dom0 other than having (obviously) Xen
installed. All required dependencies are provided by Xen installation.

Xen XL toolkit is required (which is the default for current Xen
distributions).


INSTALLATION for Dom0
=====================

On the build system, execute build of "membalance" as described in build howto.
Transfer pre-built directory src/membalance with all its subdirectories to Dom0
using ftp, NFS, rsync or any other transfer channel.

Within target directory execute as root:

    # make install
    # service membalance start
    
Configure /etc/membalance.conf (often just default settings would do fine, at
least initially) and execute the command to make membalanced daemon to re-read
the settings from /etc/membalance.conf:

    # service membalance reload
    
After configuring membalance settings in managed DomU's configuration files
and installing memprobe in managed DomU's (as described below) restart those
domains.

A way to begin managing a domain without restarting it will be provided with
a subsequent version of membalance.
    
To uninstall:    

    # service membalance stop
    # make uninstall


PREREQUISITES for DomU
======================

Install the latest libxenstore package, e.g. libxenstore3.0.
For example on Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install libxenstore3.0
  

INSTALLATION for DomU
=====================

On the build system, execute build of "memprobe" as described in build howto.
Transfer pre-built directory src/memprobe with all its subdirectories to DomU
using ftp, NFS, rsync or any other transfer channel.

Within target directory execute as root:

    # make install
    # service memprobe start
    
To uninstall:    

    # service memprobe stop
    # make uninstall
